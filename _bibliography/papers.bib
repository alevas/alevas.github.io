    abstract = "As Transformers have become state-of-the-art models for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, the need to understand and explain their predictions is increasingly apparent. Especially in unsupervised applications, such as information retrieval tasks, similarity models built on top of foundation model representations have been widely applied. However, their inner prediction mechanisms have mostly remained opaque. Recent advances in explainable AI have made it possible to mitigate these limitations by leveraging improved explanations for Transformers through layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP). Using BiLRP, an extension developed for computing second-order explanations in bilinear similarity models, we investigate which feature interactions drive similarity in NLP models. We validate the resulting explanations and demonstrate their utility in three corpus-level use cases, analyzing grammatical interactions, multilingual semantics, and biomedical text retrieval. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of different semantic similarity tasks and models, highlighting how novel explainable AI methods enable in-depth analyses and corpus-level insights.",

  abstract = "Matching images to text plays an important role in cross-media retrieval and research has proven this to be an underestimated challenge. This problem is addressed by the MediaEval 2021 News-Images Challenge with the goal to gain more insights into the real-world relationship of news articles and images. We develop models for re-establishing the connection of a news article to its corresponding image using datasets of a German news publisher (“task 1”). Our approaches follow the idea of pairwise similarity learning and are optimized by algorithmic hill climbing. Addition- ally, we employ Canonical Correlation Analysis as an approach using joint embedding learning. The evaluation shows that our approaches produce good results for the underlying image-text rematching task, yet require further optimization to yield stable prediction performance"
